        <h2>Welcome to NETSFanUKR!</h2>
        <p>Celebrating the Brooklyn Nets and their fans in Ukraine. The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional
            basketball team based in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The Nets compete in the National Basketball
            Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home
            games at Barclays Center. They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other is the New York
            Knicks. The club was established in 1967 as a charter franchise of the NBA's rival league, the American
            Basketball Association (ABA). They played in New Jersey as the New Jersey Americans during their first
            season, before relocating to Long Island, New York, in 1968 and changing their name to the New York Nets.
            During this time, the Nets won two ABA championships (in 1974 and 1976). In 1976, the ABA merged with the
            NBA, and the Nets were absorbed into the NBA along with three other ABA teams (the San Antonio Spurs,
            Indiana Pacers, and Denver Nuggets), all of whom remain in the league to this day.
            In 1977, the team returned to New Jersey and played as the New Jersey Nets from 1977 to 2012. Led by star
            point guard Jason Kidd, the Nets reached the NBA Finals in two consecutive NBA seasons (2001–02 and
            2002–03), but failed to win a championship. In the summer of 2012, the team moved to Barclays Center in
            Brooklyn, becoming the first major sports franchise in the borough since the departure of the Brooklyn
            Dodgers baseball team in 1957. Since moving to Brooklyn, the Nets have qualified for the playoffs on eight
            occasions, including trips to the Conference Semifinals in 2014 and 2021.

        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Brooklyn Nets were founded in 1967 and initially played in Teaneck, New Jersey, as the New Jersey
            Americans. In its early years, the team led a nomadic existence, moving to Long Island in 1968 and playing
            in various arenas there as the New York Nets.

            Led by Hall of Famer Julius "Dr. J" Erving, the Nets won two ABA championships in New York before becoming
            one of four ABA teams to be admitted into the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. Unlike the other
            three ABA teams entering the NBA, who played in cities without any NBA presence, the Nets were required by
            the NBA to pay an "encroachment fee" of $4.8 million (equivalent to $25 million in 2022) to the New York
            Knicks. The team financed that payment by selling Erving's contract to the Philadelphia 76ers and the Nets
            went from winning the last ABA title in 1975–76 to having the worst record in the NBA in 1976–77. The team
            then moved back to New Jersey in 1977 and became the New Jersey Nets. During their time in the state, the
            Nets played in two consecutive NBA Finals in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, led on the court by point
            guard Jason Kidd.

            After playing 35 seasons in New Jersey, the team moved back to the state of New York, changed its geographic
            name to Brooklyn, and began playing in the new Barclays Center, starting with the 2012–13 NBA season. The
            team's move from New Jersey to Brooklyn was approved unanimously by the NBA Board of Governors on April 13,
            2012.

        <h2>Rivalries</h2>
        <h3>Boston Celtics</h3>
        <p>During the early 2000s, the Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Boston Celtics were
            experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the
            2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics, who claimed Martin was
            a "fake" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the
            stands. Celtic fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of "Wife Beater!" in response to Kidd's 2001
            domestic abuse charge. When the series returned to New Jersey, Nets fans responded, with some brandishing
            signs that read "Will someone please stab Paul Pierce?" referring to a night club incident in 2000 in which
            Pierce was stabbed 11 times. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, "Our fans
            hate them, their fans hate us." Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the "beginning of the
            next great NBA rivalry" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002. Led by Kidd, the Nets advanced to the
            NBA Finals, and the following year, swept Boston in the 2003 playoffs.

            On November 28, 2012, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation
            occurred on the court, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo
            was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined. The story was
            revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees
            and players alike.

            In the 2019 NBA off-season, the Nets signed point guard Kyrie Irving. Coming off two seasons with the
            Celtics, Irving was described as selfish by many critics. This impression caused many Celtics fans to blame
            him for the Celtics' inability to get through to the playoffs.

            During a regular season game in the 2019–20 season between the Celtics and Nets, the Celtics' fans displayed
            their displeasure with Irving by chanting "Kyrie sucks" in TD Garden. When the series returned to Brooklyn
            two days later, the Nets' fans chanted "Kyrie's better" in response to the chants in Boston. The "Kyrie's
            Better" chants reference to how the Celtics signed Kemba Walker after Irving left for the Nets.

            On May 30, 2021, a fan threw a water bottle at Irving at TD Garden following a Nets victory and a 3-1 lead
            in the series.</p>
        <h3>New York Knicks<img></img>.</h3>
        <p>The Knicks–Nets rivalry has historically been a geographical one, with the Knicks playing in Madison Square
            Garden in the New York City borough of Manhattan, while the Nets played in the suburban area of Long Island
            and in New Jersey, and since 2012 have been playing at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted
            the Knicks–Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as the Major League
            Baseball (MLB) Subway Series rivalry between the American League (AL)'s New York Yankees and the National
            League (NL)'s New York Mets, and the National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the National Football
            Conference (NFC)'s New York Giants and the American Football Conference (AFC)'s New York Jets, the result of
            the boroughs' proximity through the New York City subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and
            Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New
            York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn,
            respectively, and were fierce intraleague rivals.The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York
            Rangers of the National Hockey League took on a similar dimension while the Islanders inhabited the Barclays
            Center, from 2015 to 2021. Due to the Knicks being located in Manhattan and the Nets being located in
            Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry "Clash of the Boroughs".</p>
        <h3>Toronto Raptors</h3>
        <p>The rivalry with the Toronto Raptors began in the 2000s, specifically in 2004, after Raptors guard/forward
            Vince Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets. However, the two teams did not meet in the playoffs until
            2007, when the Nets defeated the Raptors in the first round series, 4 games to 2, after a go-ahead shot by
            Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 led to a 98–97 victory. Seven years later, the teams met
            again in the first round, and the series went to seven games, with a game-winning block by Paul Pierce,
            giving the Nets the 104–103 victory.The series was noted for controversy when Toronto Raptors general
            manager Masai Ujiri made derogatory remarks towards Brooklyn at a fan rally outside Maple Leaf Square in
            Toronto before Game 1. Ujiri later apologized at halftime. The Raptors and Nets faced each other in the 2020
            NBA playoffs in the first round, with Toronto winning the series four games to none.</p>
